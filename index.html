                    Visual regression testing will help you modify your CSS with confidence<br>
                    Functional CSS has some benefits over the standard way of writing the CSS<br>
                    No ultimate way to write CSS<br>

                        CSS rules get complicated<br>
                        They depend on each other because the selectors are chained or because of cascading<br>
                        When you try to remove unused rules, something else will break<br>
                        You try to remove the font-size for menu, but this will affect the other rule<br>
                        Most developers will leave the CSS there<br>
                        Nothing bad will happen if you leave the old CSS, and you can always overwrite them with new rules<br>

                    Not like with programming languages, where you can refactor at any time<br>
                    Refactoring legacy Java project is easy, you have tests<br>
                    For a huge legacy CSS, the best thing you can do is to rewrite it<br>
                    There is no way to refactor this efficiently, especially if it's just a bunch of spaghetti rules without any general conception in mind<br>
                    And rewriting CSS from scratch is not something that any manager will let you do (unless redesigning the website)<br>

                            The first idea would be to find a way to write tests for CSS<br>
                            Since tests for programming languages will help you when you modify the code, same should work for CSS<br>
                            I don't mean tests that check if a given element has a class or a specific rule<br>
                            No, I mean actually testing how the website looks<br>
                            You modify CSS, open the browser, log in, click some buttons, resize for mobile and tablet<br>

                            Except that you would be playing the same game over and over again with different kinds of changes<br>
                            Tedious and boring, if you have more than few pages you will miss some bugs only to find them later with no idea which change broke them<br>
                            Since human are not really good at this game, let's have machines play it<br>

                            Writing tests only for the visual regressions can be annoying<br>
                            You already have to write unit, functional, integration, acceptance and god only know what kind of tests<br>
                            For some programming languages you can find tools that will allow you to integrate visual regression testing with you existing functional tests<br>
                            You are using the cucumber testing framework, there is specter<br>
                            It will give you a nice web interface and you can send the screenshots directly from the cucumber functional tests<br>

                            But what is a real kicker for me is a way to add visual regression testing as a part of your continuous integration cycle and that's possible with percy.io<br>
                            You can easily integrate percy.io with Travis, Jenkins or other popular CI tools<br>
                            It supports Python, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails, Ember and static websites<br>
                            Features like freezing animations<br>
                            I have tried them before and there were some annoying bugs that they seems to fix recently, so I hope it's quite usable right now<br>

                        Visual regressions testing sounds great but there are problems with it<br>
                        On top of the normal issues with tests (update over and over again), they have some other culprits<br>
                        Increasing number of documents in the database or random blog post?<br>
                        Your tests will fail each time that number or that blog post changes<br>
                        You can select what to compare or what to ignore<br>
                        For tools like PhantomCSS, where you don't actually include them as a part of some CI tests suite but you run it on your local machine - if you share the screenshots with your team,...<br>
                        Different OS and graphic card? Fail<br>
                        Different configuration (Chromium instead of Chrome)? Fail<br>
                        CI solves those issues<br>

                            You should create separate classes for the structure that will define how the button or a modal looks like and separate classes for the skin of those elements<br>
                            Like an alert button will have a red color and info button will have blue color<br>
                            If you use frameworks like Bootstrap, you should be familiar with this pattern as this is exactly what Bootstrap is doing<br>

                            Think of HTML and CSS in 3 categories: block, element, modifier<br>
                            Any independent element of your website is a block, like the menu block<br>
                            All the pieces of code that live inside that block and don't make much sense outside of it are Elements, for example menu elements that live inside the menu block<br>
                            Apply some modifications to the block or the element (active menu item), you use the modifier<br>
                            Very simple, but after using it for a while, I can say that it's super efficient<br>

                        Immutable - you are 100% sure that once you declare a property, nothing will overwrite it (no specificity fight)<br>

                        No matter where you put a given element on a page, if you add class with 1 rem font size, it will have this exact font size<br>

                            You can modify styles for HTML elements without the fear that you will break something (image that no longer needs to float to the right example)<br>
                            If you remove a class or a CSS rule, you need to check other places if everything still works fine (cascading, so there can be consequences that you won't easily see), so developers will leave the old CSS code<br>
                            You no longer have to fight with the specificity when you add a new rule just because Bootstrap had to chain 5 classes together to make something work<br>
                            All classes have the same specificity level (which is just one class)  - it will make modifications way easier. Adding RTL support is easy (or different theme colors)<br>
                            Good luck writing a template for Bootstrap<br>
                            Once you learn the most common class names, you will be actually coding way faster (div with small margin on top and black background example)<br>
                            If you have to write the same set of classes over and over again, you will quickly get bored and you will probably create an HTML component (and that's good, it makes your code DRY)<br>
                            Before you start working on a project, you go through the clean framework and adjust all settings according to the design vision (different heading sizes according to some typeset tools, make the different margin sizes consistent)<br>
                            Then, you will start coding and you no longer will have to think how many pixels you need for margins<br>
                            You are no longer distracted with the small design decisions when coding.<br>
                            When you change the styling by changing the CSS classes in the HTML, you won't have problems with invalidation the cache<br>
                            You might actually find out that after switching to functional CSS, you not only have less CSS files to download, but the overall size of your website went down, since you no longer duplicate the CSS rules<br>

                            When you switch to functional CSS, instead of duplicating the CSS rules, you will duplicate the CSS classes<br>
                            So instead of having a messy CSS files, we now have a messy HTML files, right<br>
                            You can and you should create HTML components for the parts of your website that are repeated often<br>
                            Every framework provides you with some way to create components<br>

                            Imagine that your designer decides that we should change the font family of multiple elements and maybe add more margin to all buttons<br>
                            With standard way of writing the CSS, if you separate the classes using some of the existing methodologies, you can just open the CSS files concerned with your changes and use find-replace to quickly apply your changes<br>
                            With functional CSS, you will have to modify all the HTML components and replace the existing classes, which indeed can take more time<br>
                            And probably the biggest problem for many developers is that it won't work with Bootstrap or other non-functional CSS that give you a lot of styling out of the box<br>
                            Bootstrap relies on cascading, functional CSS doesn't<br>
                            Bootstrap rules have higher specificity<br>
                            You can use !important<br>

                            So, does it mean that we no longer have to write CSS with functional CSS?<br>
                            No, you will still write CSS for stuff that can't be reusable<br>

                            And Functional CSS is not a religion, it's a tool<br>
                            In my opinion, if you really want to have CSS classes with a set of rules instead of HTML components, nothing stops you<br>
                            You can create a CSS for a generic element that you know it won't change often and you want to reuse in multiple places<br>
                            For example, if you want a modal for your website, just create this modal class<br>
                            Then if you need a bigger modal, just add 'width-50' class<br>
                            If you put the CSS in a correct order and you don't increase the selectors specificity, you shouldn't get into many problems<br>
                            To actually make it better, just add the styles that you know you won't need to overwrite and then add the remaining styles with functional classes<br>

                            Functional CSS is not a silver bullet (there are no silver bullets in CSS, there are just less painful ways of doing stuff), but it might solve some of the problems that you have.<br>

                            At the end when it comes to CSS it all boils down to the "CSS bloat vs HTML bloat" since you data has to live somewhere.<br>
                            At some point you will have to make a choice between one of those two solutions and which one you prefer, it's up to you.
