* There is no one, ultimate and correct way to write CSS. Sooner or later, CSS will make you miserable and will become hard to maintain (so exactly like with JavaScript, except that for JS it happens way faster).
* What's the problem with CSS?:
    - The main problem is the "C" in CSS - it's cascading. It's nice idea that the styles of some elements will inherit the styles of some other elements, but once you code grows bigger it actually starts getting in your way. You try to modify one element only to find out that you just broke 5 other pages.
    - Once your CSS starts growing, it gets harder to maintain. Specificity of some selectors gets in your way (especially if you are using some frameworks), so your CSS rules gets more and more complicated. Soon, that's not enough and you start using IDs or !important, just for the styling purposes.
    - The bigger the CSS file already is, the faster a duplicated or unused code starts appearing in there. Why? Let's say a developer needs to add a new button. There are already 10 different buttons but this one is different, so he creates a new class. Later someone decides that we need to normalize the look of the buttons and they decide to use only one style of buttons on the website. Maybe someone decides to remove the CSS for unused buttons, but it's possible that this code depended on some other CSS rules (because of siblings or children selectors) and you end up breaking things. So the old code stays, just in case. That's how you get the unused code. And how do you get duplicates? Imagine you have more than one person working on the CSS. Crazy, right? But it happens. So someone creates a class for a menu and names it 'menu'. The other developer needs to create a navigation on a different page and since there is no 'navigation' class, he creates one. And both the menu and navigation look pretty similar, but since there are more elements inside, they can't be merged into one element, so both versions stay. That's how you get the duplicated code.
* And it's not like with the programming languages, where you can refactor your code at any time. When you get assigned to a legacy project in let's say Java or Python that looks bad, you can start refactoring it with small steps and piece by piece, you will refactor the whole code base. For a huge legacy CSS, the best thing you can do is to rewrite it. There is no way to refactor this efficiently, especially if it's just a bunch of spaghetti rules without any general conception in mind (which is usually try for a lot of CSS.). And rewriting CSS from scratch is not something that any manager will let you do, unless you are redesigning the website.
* So what can we do with this problem?
    - The first idea would be to find a way to write tests for CSS. Since tests for programming languages will greatly help you refactoring it, the same should apply to CSS. You might be thinking - what the hell I mean by tests for CSS?
    - Well, each time you modify the CSS on your website, you will probably open a few pages to see if everything looks fine. If your website is supposed to be responsive, maybe you will resize the browser to see if everything looks fine on the mobile or a tablet. It's like playing this game when you have 2 pictures that look almost the same and your task is to find 5 differences. Except that you would be playing the same fucking game over and over again with different kind of changes. And this is a terribly tedious and boring task, not to mention that once you get more than few sub pages, you are likely to miss a bug or two only to notice them way later when you will have no idea what exactly broke it. A better idea would be to have a tool that will do this tedious work for us. And this is why the visual regression testing was invented.
    - Visual regression test takes a screenshot of your website or part of your website and after you make some modification and run the tests, it takes another screenshot of the same part of the website. Then it compares those 2 screenshots, pixel by pixel and if something is different, the test is failing, usually presenting you with a diff between these two images.
    - There are many tools for visual regression tests, starting from the most well known - PhantomCSS. In this case, you install it on your local machine, write some visual tests where you basically define the setup part like, logging in and filling some fields and then you tell it to take a screenshot. The screenshot will be saved as a baseline for future tests. Now, if you run the tests again, PhantomCSS will take another screenshot and compare it with the previous one. If there are some changes between the two screenshots, you will get a failing test. You can now decided if the change was expected (so the newest screenshot will replace the baseline image and will be used for the next comparisons) or you can go and modify the CSS if the change was unexpected.
    - Writing tests only for the visual regressions can be annoying (you already have to write unit, functional, integration, acceptance and god only know what kind of tests), so for some programming languages you can find tools that will allow you to integrate visual regression testing with you existing functional tests. For example, the spectre application is a nice diff tool that will allow you to send screenshots to comparison directly from your cucumber tests for rake tasks.
    - But what is a real kicker for me is a way to add visual regression testing as a part of your continuous integration cycle and that's possible with percy.io. You can easily integrate percy.io with Travis, Jenkins or other popular CI tools, it only supports Python, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails, Ember and static websites. It's a quite new tool but they already have many nice features like freezing animations. I have tried them before and there were some annoying bugs that they seems to fix recently, so I hope it's quite usable right now. Hopefully there will be more tools like that showing in the future.
    - I'm also listing two other tools for visual regression testing in Python if you want to take a look.
+ Visual regressions testing sounds great but there are problems with it. If you don't like writing unit tests, then you will probably like writing regression tests even less. On top of the normal issues with tests which is that you have to update them over and over again, visual regressions have some other culprits.
    - Imagine you have a number somewhere on your website that can change (for example, the number of documents created by your user) or some blog posts that are selected by random. Well, then probably your tests will fail each time that number or that blog post changes. So you have to think carefully what you want to compare. Fortunately, most of the tools allow you to select what exactly you want to compare or even to ignore some parts of the website.
    - Now, for tools like PhantomCSS, where you don't actually include them as a part of some CI tests suite but you run it on your local machine - if you share it with your team, it's possible that the tests will fail only because a different OS and different graphic card now generates slightly different image. Also, it's possible that their machine will be configured differently and instead of using Chrome, they will have Chromium and that will also make your tests fail. A lot of those problems are solved by the CI tools like percy.
