* There is no one, ultimate and correct way to write CSS. Sooner or later, CSS will make you miserable and will become hard to maintain (so exactly like with JavaScript, except that for JS it happens way faster).
* What's the problem with CSS?:
    - The main problem is the "C" in CSS - it's cascading. It's nice idea that the styles of some elements will inherit the styles of some other elements, but once you code grows bigger it actually starts getting in your way. You try to modify one element only to find out that you just broke 5 other pages.
    - Once your CSS starts growing, it gets harder to maintain. Specificity of some selectors gets in your way (especially if you are using some frameworks), so your CSS rules gets more and more complicated. Soon, that's not enough and you start using IDs or !important, just for the styling purposes.
    - The bigger the CSS file already is, the faster a duplicated or unused code starts appearing in there. Why? Let's say a developer needs to add a new button. There are already 10 different buttons but this one is different, so he creates a new class. Later someone decides that we need to normalize the look of the buttons and they decide to use only one style of buttons on the website. Maybe someone decides to remove the CSS for unused buttons, but it's possible that this code depended on some other CSS rules (because of siblings or children selectors) and you end up breaking things. So the old code stays, just in case. That's how you get the unused code. And how do you get duplicates? Imagine you have more than one person working on the CSS. Crazy, right? But it happens. So someone creates a class for a menu and names it 'menu'. The other developer needs to create a navigation on a different page and since there is no 'navigation' class, he creates one. And both the menu and navigation look pretty similar, but since there are more elements inside, they can't be merged into one element, so both versions stay. That's how you get the duplicated code.
    - And it's not like with the programming languages, where you can refactor your code at any time. When you get assigned to a legacy project in let's say Java or Python that looks bad, you can start refactoring it with small steps and piece by piece, you will refactor the whole code base. For a huge legacy CSS, the best thing you can do is to rewrite it. There is no way to refactor this efficiently, especially if it's just a bunch of spaghetti rules without any general conception in mind (which is usually try for a lot of CSS.). And rewriting CSS from scratch is not something that any manager will let you do, unless you are redesigning the website.
